  <div class="qa-container">

    <div class="qa-box">
      <div class="question">Who really controls the flow of your money before you ever see it?</div>
      <div class="answer">
        It’s not your government, but shadowy financial institutions and corporate interests. Taxes are collected and funneled into wars, bailouts, and programs that enrich the elite—while the average citizen gets crumbs and surveillance.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-box">
      <div class="question">Why do our elected officials prioritize corporate donors over their own voters?</div>
      <div class="answer">
        Because the system is designed to serve power, not people. Lobbyists spend billions to buy influence. Representatives become puppets, not leaders, ensuring the cycle of corruption remains unbroken.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-box">
      <div class="question">What if the “war on terror” was really a war on your freedoms and wealth?</div>
      <div class="answer">
        Endless military spending is a cover for expanding government control and profiting private defense contractors—while eroding civil liberties and normalizing fear to keep you compliant.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-box">
      <div class="question">Why are vital public services underfunded while billions vanish in opaque government budgets?</div>
      <div class="answer">
        Because money is systematically redirected into black budgets and secret projects, away from schools, hospitals, and infrastructure—keeping citizens dependent and distracted.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa-box">
      <div class="question">How long will you let invisible hands pull your strings before you cut the cords?</div>
      <div class="answer">
        Freedom begins with awareness and action. The moment you realize you’re a pawn is the moment you start reclaiming your power—through knowledge, refusal, and building alternatives.
      </div>
