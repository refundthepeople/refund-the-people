  <h1>Wake Up — Ask the Real Questions</h1>

  <h2>Who truly benefits from the endless wars funded by your taxes?</h2>
  <p>If not the citizens, then who? And what do they gain from your sacrifice?</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>Why is education underfunded while military spending breaks records every year?</h2>
  <p>What kind of society prioritizes destruction over knowledge?</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>How much of your paycheck disappears before you even see it—and where does it really go?</h2>
  <p>Have you ever received a clear, honest accounting?</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>Why do your representatives take millions from lobbyists yet claim to serve you?</h2>
  <p>Is their loyalty to you, or to the system that pays them?</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>What happens if millions of people simply refuse to fund corruption?</h2>
  <p>Is the power of your wallet the last true power you hold?</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>If freedom is your birthright, why does your government treat you like a taxpayer, not a citizen?</h2>
  <p>When will you start demanding your full rights back?</p>
